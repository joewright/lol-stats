# lol-stats

This is a quick demo using react/express/kayn to show recent match results for a given summoner.

## Requirements
- node 8+
- your own LoL API key

## Getting started

After cloning the repo, you can run it locally by doing
```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run the server
npm run start
```

You can now view the app at http://localhost:3000.

## Live Demo

If I remembered to reset my LoL test API key, you can see it running at https://dry-basin-46299.herokuapp.com/
