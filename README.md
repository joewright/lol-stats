# lol-stats

This is a quick demo using react/express/kayn to show recent match results for a given summoner.

## Requirements
- node 8+
- your own LoL API key

## Getting started

After cloning the repo, copy [example.env](./example.env) to a new file called `.env`. Be sure to set your own API key in there.

Install dependencies via
```bash
npm install
```

Run the server via
```bash
npm run start
```

You can now view the app at http://localhost:3000.


## Live Demo

If I remembered to reset my LoL test API key, you can see it running at https://dry-basin-46299.herokuapp.com/
